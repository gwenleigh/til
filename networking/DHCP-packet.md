# DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. It allows devices to receive necessary configuration information, such as <mark style="background-color: hsla(48, 100%, 91%, 0.5)">IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS server addresses</mark>, dynamically without manual intervention.

## DHCP packet
A DHCP packet is a formatted unit of <mark style="background-color: hsla(48, 100%, 91%, 0.5)">data carried by the protocol during the DHCP communication process</mark>. Essentially, it is the data that is exchanged between the client (the device requesting configuration) and the server (the device providing configuration).
- DHCP Client - Server data exchange
    - During DHCP communication

##  Differences Between DHCP and DHCP Packet
- **DHCP (the Protocol)**: Refers to the <mark style="background-color: hsla(48, 100%, 91%, 0.5)">overall system and set of rules</mark> used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network including the processes, server, client, and relay agents.
- **DHCP Packet**: Refers specifically to the data unit used in the DHCP protocol communication. It is the means by which the information is exchanged between the DHCP server and client.
