# GLAN and VLAN

GLAN enhances network speed and performance, while VLAN improves network organization, security, and management.

### GLAN (Gigabit Local Area Network)

****Definition****: GLAN refers to a local area network (LAN) that operates at gigabit speeds, typically 1 Gbps (gigabit per second).
**Purpose**: It is used to provide high-speed network connections within a limited geographic area, such as within a building or campus.
**Technology**: GLAN uses gigabit Ethernet standards, such as 1000BASE-T, which can transmit data at 1 Gbps over copper cables (CAT 5e, CAT6 ) or fiber optic cables.

### VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

**Definition**: VLAN is a method of creating separate, logical networks within a single physical network infrastructure.
**Purpose**: VLANs segment network traffic, improve security, and enhance performance by isolating different segments of a network. They can group devices based on function, department, or application, regardless of their physical location.
**Technology**: VLANs are implemented using network switches and routers that support IEEE 802.1Q standard for tagging Ethernet frames to identify VLAN membership.

## Key Differences

### Scope

**GLAN**: Refers to the speed and capability of the physical network.
**VLAN**: Refers to the logical segmentation of the network.

### Function

**GLAN**: Focuses on providing high-speed connectivity.
**VLAN**: Focuses on network management, security, and traffic isolation.
