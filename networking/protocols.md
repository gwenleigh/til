# Protocols

1) A protocol in networking is a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received across a network. 
2) These protocols exist at various layers of the network stack, each responsible for specific functions.
3) Protocol (general) and application protocol (layer 7) are two different things.

- **Ethernet** (L2, data link): A protocol for local area network (LAN) communication.
- **IP** (Internet Protocol) (L3, network): A protocol for routing and addressing packets across networks.
- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) (L4, transport): A protocol to ensure reliable, ordered delivery of data.
- **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) (L4, transport): a protocol that allows for fast, but less reliable, transmission of data.

## Application protocols
1) Application protocols operate at the application layer (Layer 7 in the OSI model). 

2) Application layer protocols are used in computer networking to enable communication ***between different software applications across networks***. 

3) They define the format and sequence of messages exchanged ***between applications*** and how application data should be processed.

**Examples**
- **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Used by web browsers and servers to exchange web pages.
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between a client and a server.
- **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails.
- **DNS** (Domain Name System): Used for translating domain names into IP addresses.

## Differences
General protocols handle the mechanics of data transfer across networks, and application protocols facilitate specific end-user services and functions.  
- **Protocol**: Can operate at various layers of the network stack, including data link, network, transport, and application layers.
- **Application Protocol**: Specifically operates at the application layer (Layer 7).

## Visualization in the OSI Model
- **Physical Layer** (1): Electrical/optical signals (e.g., Ethernet physical layer).
- **Data Link Layer** (2): Data frames between adjacent nodes (e.g., Ethernet).
- **Network Layer** (3): Routing of packets across networks (e.g., IP).
- **Transport Layer** (4): Reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP) or fast transfer (e.g., UDP).
- **Session Layer** (5): Managing sessions or connections (e.g., NetBIOS).
- **Presentation Layer** (6): Data translation, encryption, and compression (e.g., SSL/TLS).
- **Application Layer** (7): End-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
