# DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module)

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/dimm)
- "A dual in-line memory module (DIMM) is a common type of computer memory modular hardware used in desktops, laptops and servers consisting of multiple random access memory chips (RAM) on a single printed circuit board."

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM)
- a popular type of memory module used in computers. It is a printed circuit board with one or both sides (front and back) holding DRAM chips and pins. 
- The vast majority of DIMMs are standardized through JEDEC standards, although there are proprietary DIMMs. 
- DIMMs come in a variety of speeds and sizes, but generally are one of two lengths 
    - PC which are 133.35 mm (5.25 in) and;
    - laptop (SO-DIMM) which are about half the size at 67.60 mm (2.66 in).

## DIMM vs. RAM
1) RAM (Random Access Memory) refers to the memory technology itself, while DIMM refers to the physical form factor that contains the RAM chips. 
2) When you buy RAM for a computer, you're actually buying DIMMs that you will install in the motherboard slots.
3) In other words, RAM comes in various forms, and DIMM is one of those forms

## Memory Module
A Memory Module is a multiple number of memory chips mounted on a substrate.

### Types 
#### 1. SIMM (Single Inline Memory Module):
- An older form factor that was used before DIMMs became standard.
- Available in types such as FPM (Fast Page Mode) and EDO (Extended Data Out) RAM.

#### 2. DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module): 
- Commonly used in desktops and servers.
- Includes various types such as DDR (Double Data Rate) SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM), DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5.

#### 3. SO-DIMM (Small Outline DIMM):
- A smaller form factor of DIMM used mainly in laptops and compact devices.
- Similar to DIMMs, they come in types like DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5.

#### 4. NVDIMM (Non-Volatile DIMM):
- A type of memory module that combines the speed of DRAM with the persistence of NAND flash.
- Used in applications requiring data retention after power loss.

#### 5. RIMM (Rambus Inline Memory Module):
- Used in some older systems, based on Rambus DRAM technology.
- Less common now.
